# PiCameraClassifier

## Description
This project aims to utilize a rasberry pi 3 to calculate the frequency of truck and buses on the street outside my house. Since we live near a FedEx distribution center I am particularly interested in counting the number fedex delivery trucks on my street.

Although I am just getting started it seems very easy to retrain a tensorflow deep learning algorithm through transfer learning, and uploading that model to the rasberry pi. See instructions [here](https://svds.com/tensorflow-image-recognition-raspberry-pi/) and tensorflow retraining [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0). Additional training images can be found in Imagenet [here](http://www.image-net.org/synset?wnid=n03173929#) and from the rasberry pi camera feed,  

I started with the Adafruit Rasberry pi 3 camera kit, although it's much cheaper to buy through Arrow.com [here](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/3275/adafruit-industries). Full kit for 88$ plus free next day shipping (at least to DC)! Camera setup instructions can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-wifi-raspberry-pi-touch-cam)
